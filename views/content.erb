Great value, straight from the source
VinoVitae works directly with wine makers. There are no middlemen, which means you get better wine for less. Shipping directly to you also means we can invest in smaller, more unique lots. We're not subject to volume quotas and don't have expensive brand marketing campaigns to support. Learn more about our wines.

Manage your Experience on the go
Our mobile apps give you easy access to your VinoVitae Experience whenever, wherever. Add and remove bottles, skip a shipment, update your address, all from the palm of your hand. You can also scan the barcode on your VinoVitae bottles from our apps to directly access our Tastemaker videos, rate the wine or to order more.

Learn as you drink (or don't)
Learning about wine should be fun, not overbearing or pretentious. We produce a short video for every wine featuring one of our curators that includes tasting notes and other background information such as the producer's story, an explanation of the growing region or a primer on the varietal. Scanning the bar code on every bottle that we ship with our apps will take you directly to the video. It's an easy, un-obtrusive way to learn about the wine you're about to enjoy, if you're so inclined.
